"""
Here, a pre-trained GPT-2 model is employed to generate text from controlled 
prompts aimed at probing for social biases and hallucination tendencies. 
After text generation, the project analyzes the output by counting gendered 
or stereotypical terms to assess bias. It also detects potential hallucination 
by checking for excessive repetition of n-grams. The resulting analysis is 
compiled into a report that highlights both the presence of bias and the 
likelihood of hallucinated content, serving as a useful diagnostic tool for 
evaluating the social risks associated with language model outputs.
